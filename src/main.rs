        A random data generator CLI tool.

        Contains a number of (pseudo) random number generator (PRNG) algorithms.
        Given one of these it prints an infinite stream of bytes generated from
        that algorithm to stdout.

        By default this tool operates in a multi threaded mode where new worker threads are
        spawned until the write speed to stdout is saturated. This means multiple PRNG instances
        are executed in parallel and their generated data is interleaved to stdout. See
        --max-threads for more.
